# Planet Hunting in Python

## Outline
NASA’s Kepler spacecraft was launched in 2009 and spent approximately 4 years staring at 150,000 stars, searching for planets orbiting around them using the transit detection method. The mission resulted in the discovery of 4717 exoplanet candidates, of which 2303 have been confirmed as bona fide planets, and a number of which are found to reside in multi-planet systems. More recently, NASA’s TESS planet hunting mission was launched and is now taking data. During your research, you will learn to write computer programmes in the Python programming language, and you will use your newly developed skills to write routines to analyse data from the Kepler and TESS missions using simplified algorithms. You will analyse light curves that have been downloaded from the Kepler and TESS spacecraft, and determine the key physical parameters of the planetary systems including orbital periods, orbital inclinations to the line of sight, orbital semi-major axes (i.e. the distance between the star and the planet), and the physical radii of the planets. You will learn about fitting models to data, and techniques for optimising the accuracy of these models. Based on your analysis, you will be able to draw conclusions about the observed population of exoplanets, including whether or not they look like the planets in our Solar Systems, and explore how dynamical interactions between planets in multi-planet systems can be detected in the data.

## Introduction
The first extrasolar planet discovered orbiting a Sun-like star was 51 Pegasi b (Mayor & Queloz 1995), and this discovery led to Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2019. During the 24 years since this ground-breaking discovery, the total number of confirmed extrasolar planets has increased to 4,0731 with new discoveries being made on an almost daily basis. We now know that the population of exoplanets in our Galaxy is very diverse, and that our Solar System does not provide an example of the most typical architecture.

The launch of the Kepler spacecraft in March 2009 heralded a dramatic improvement in our knowledge about exoplanets (Borucki et al 2010). Kepler was launched into an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit, which allowed it to stare
continuously at one region of the sky for a period of approximately 4 years2. The mission used the transit detection technique to find planets. This method looks for the periodic dimming of the light from a star as seen by an observer when a planet passes in front of the star during its orbit (see Fig. 1).For geometrical reasons, most planetary orbits around distant stars do not cause the planet to pass in front of the star when observed by the Kepler spacecraft. For a randomly orientated orbit the probability of observing a transit is typically about 1%, so for this reason the Kepler spacecraft monitored the brightness of approximately 150,000 stars for the duration of the mission, resulting in the discovery of 4717 planet candidates, of which 2303 have been confirmed to be genuine exoplanets. Note that there are numerous ways in which different astrophysical phenomena can mimic a transiting planet, hence the need for additional observations that are able to confirm the planetary nature of the Kepler planet candidate systems.
The Kepler spacecraft produced data in the form of light curves for each of the observed stars – data files that list the time of observation and the brightness of the star over an extended period of time. These light curves were then processed to remove artefacts and other unwanted features from the data (a process known as detrending) prior to the data being made available for scientists to analyse. See Fig. 2 for an example of a detrended light curve. You will use these detrended light curves in your analysis, and one of the things that you will learn is how to download the data files for individual systems from the Kepler data archive so that you can choose which systems to analyse.

A primary aim of this project is to provide hands-on experience of programming in Python within the context of astronomical data analysis. Python is becoming a commonly used programming language in many areas of life, including in the scientific world where it is used for data analysis and mathematical modelling, and in schools and universities where it is becoming the language of choice when teaching computer programming. Python’s increasing popularity arises for a number of reasons: it is free to use; it runs under all operating systems (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux); its basic structure and syntax is similar to many other languages; it contains the ability to perform mathematical calculations and to plot data in graphical form within a self-contained programming package. Later in this document you will be provided with a sequence of programming tasks of increasing complexity to help you develop your programming skills in incremental stages.
