# Planet Hunting with Python

## Introduction

This is a repository that builds on provided code from QMUL. We analyse data sent from NASA's Kepler spacecraft 
## Next steps

- plot models to data, optimise accuracy of the models
- draw conclusions about them, analyse how big they are, how many planets in a system perhaps

## What this repository contains

- Module for finding planet parameters
- Module for plotting piece wise function (line of best fit) | in progress
- Module for Chi-squared test
- Module for extension tasks | planned
