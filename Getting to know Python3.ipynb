    "### Variables and Data Types\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "Most of the time when writing a program we generate data that will be required later. In most modern programming languages, this necessity is handled through the use of *variables*. A variable stores a value (or values) until it is needed. It is simple to declare a variable and assign it a value in Python. Python is a \"duck typed\" language meaning that you do not have to worry much about what kind of data you are storing in your variables, rather Python itself takes care of all of that for you. A variable can have a value assigned to it using just the ```=``` operator and you are free to modify the contens of your variable at any time:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "myNumber=5 #myNumber=5\n",
    "otherNumber=6\n",
    "myNumber=myNumber + otherNumber #myNumber=11\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Lists\n",
    "Often data is more complicated than just a single number or character and storing each data element as a single variable becomes cumbersome, in these situations lists come to our rescue. In a python list you can store any number of things, as well as mixtures of things (again remember Python takes care of complicated issues with different kinds of data under the hood). To declare a list in python you use square braces:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "myList=[1,3,\"plum\",myNumber]\n",
    "```\n",
    "To then access what has been stored in the list you use square braces yet again, though slightly differently:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "myList[2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python is a *zero based language*, this means that it counts from 0. So if you are looking for the very first element fo a list, you want ``` myList[0]``` and if you want the last ```myList[-1]```, here the ```-1``` is a python shorthand for ```end-1```. The rest of the elements of the list can be found at all their respective list indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "1. Make a list containing the numbers ```[3,2,6,4,0,1]```, call it myList.\n",
    "2. Create a variable to store the sum of the first and last element of myList. \n",
    "3. Print your list and your variable\n"

    "### Doing maths in Python\n",
    "Python is a flexible language, with a whole host of inbuilt mathematical opertors to make doing maths easier, I like splitting the operators into two groups, arithmetic and logical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arithmetic operators\n",
    "These are the operators you comonly associate with maths, addition multiplication and more. The most common are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```+``` Returns the sum of two numbers ```a+b``` gives $a+b$\n",
    "\n",
    "```-``` Returns the difference of two numbers ```a-b``` gives $a-b$\n",
    "\n",
    "```*``` Returns the product of two numbers ```a*b``` gives $a\\cdot b$\n",
    "\n",
    "```/``` Returns the division of two numbers ```a/b``` gives $\\frac{a}{b}$\n",
    "\n",
    "```**``` Returns one number to the power of the other ```a**b``` gives $a^b$\n",
    "\n",
    "```%``` Returns the remainder of the division of the two numbers ```a%b``` gives $Remainder\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logical operators\n",
    "These are operators used in logic operations, like: is a bigger than b, is x smaller than y and is x bigger than y *or* smaller than a. This kind of operator returns what is called a boolean, a variable that is either ```True``` or ```False```. The common logic operators you should know in python are\n",
    "\n",
    "```==``` Equivalence, are two values equal? If yes this returns ```True``` otherwise it returns ```False```.\n",
    "\n",
    "```!=``` Unequivalence, this does the opposite of equivalence.\n",
    "\n",
    "```>```,```<``` Greater than and smaller than, this does what it says on the tin, is a greater than b and is a smaller than b.\n",
    "\n",
    "```or``` Allows you to join smaller logic expressions into bigger ones. ``` True or True``` gives ```True```,  ``` True or False``` gives ```True``` and ``` False or False``` gives ```False```.\n",
    "\n",
    "```and``` Similarly to ```or``` it can be used to join expressions, though the behaviour is different. ``` True and True``` gives ```True```,  ``` True and False``` gives ```False``` and ``` False and False``` gives ```False```."

    "### Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "In many situations the need may arise to repeat the same operation many times over. This is most often achieved with a loop, in Python there are two types of loop, for loops and while loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _for_ loops\n",
    "A for loop executes **for** a given number of iterations, in python this is acchieved by looping through the elements of a list or array, for example:\n",

    "b\n",
    "c\n",
    "d\n",
    "e\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _while_ loops\n",
    "The second type of python loop is a while loop this loop executes **while** a looping condition is met. For example if we wanted to loop until a number increasing by 1 starting from 5 is smaller than 10:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "i=5\n",
    "while i<10:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",

    "6\n",
    "7\n",
    "8\n",
    "9\n",
    "```\n",
    "The main thing to be wary of with while loops is that your loop is able to eventually terminate... so make sure your looping condition can eventually be broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loops in loops in loops... AKA nesting\n",
    "You are free to put anything inside a loop, this may be an expression, a conditional block, or another loop. Being free to do something does not always mean it is a good idea; before turning your code into a nesting doll make sure that you have thought your problem through!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "1. Using a while loop, print the even numbers between 10 and 20\n",
    "2. Correct the following, such that it terminates and only prints the odd numbers between 10 and 20\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "i=11\n",
    "while i!=20:\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "        i+=2\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Using a for loop, print the squares of these numbers, ```[2,4,6,8,10]``` and the squares' remainders when divided by 7\n",
    "4. A number in the list ```[2,3,13,27,5,6,15,23,28]``` satisfies the expression $2x^2-0.8x^3+x+2235=0$, using a for loop and an if statement to find which one it is."

    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "An important idea to keep in mind when writing code is making your code readable and hence easy to maintain and extend. A good first step in writing easy to read code is using functions. Functions take a set of arguments and produce a return, alowing for code that gets used often to get packaged away and only be written once. In python a function can be defined like so:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def my_function(firstArg, secondArg, thirdArg):\n",
    "    temporaryVariable=firstArg*secondArg+thirdArg\n",

    "b=4\n",
    "c=5\n",
    "d=my_function(a,b,c) \n",
    "```\n",
    "Whenever a function is called you should just use it like you would the value you expect the function to return, its a number? use it as a number, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "1. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns the square root of the sum of their squares, ie $f(x,y)=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ call this function ```find_hypotenuse```, now test your code\n",
    "2. Using the function you wrote, clean up the code I wrote in the cell below\n",
    "3. **Optional Challenge:** using the function you already wrote and the section on conditional execution, write a function that tests if 3 numbers (a,b,c) form the sides of a right triangle (within a tollerance of $10^{-6}$). If they are, return ```True``` otherwise return ```False```. As a further challenge, make your function work regardless of the order the sides are given in the function arguments. "

    "1. Manipulating and plotting arrays\n",
    "    * Create an array of 100 evenly spaced points in the interval $\\left[0,\\pi\\right]$ called ```X```\n",
    "    * Create another array called ```Y``` such that $Y=X\\cdot\\sin\\left(X\\right)$\n",
    "    * Plot ```Y``` against ```X``` and ```Y**2``` against ```X``` on the _same_ canvas\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the ```./supplementary_files/``` directory there is a file called ```scater_data.dat``` \n",
    "    * The file can be read at ```\"./suplementary_files/scater_data.dat\"``` it has 2 columns, read the columns into arrays called x and y. \n",
    "    * plot x against y\n",
    "    * add x and y axis labels!\n",
    "    * now plot it as a scatter, can you spot a trend?\n",
    "3. Some files may have headders, by adding ```skiprows=number_of_rows_to_skip``` to the arguments of ```np.loadtxt```, try repeating exercise 2 on ```\"./supplementary_files/scater_data_with_head.dat\"```. This file has a single row of headder, open it and check it out.\n"
