    "Before attempting this exercise, we recommend that you first work through the notebooks **GettingToKnowPython**, **KeplerDataIntro**, and **ObtainingPlanetParameters**. If possible, please make sure you are using the Classical Jyputer notebook as explained in the **KeplerDataIntro** notebook. In the code cell below, enter python code that reads in the data for the system KIC006922244, and plot the flux received from the star versus time. "

    "Use the zoom function on the plot and obtain as accurately as possible an estimate of the orbital period of the planet. Also estimate as accurately as you can the time of the midpoint of the very first transit in the data and make a note of it. Using your estimate of the orbital period (hint: the period $P=3.522X$ days where $X$ is a digit in the range $0 \\le X \\le 9$), and the time of the first transit (let's call this $t_1$), phase-fold the data so that it is symmetric about $t=0$. Plot the phase-folded light curve. Enter your python commands in the code cell below."

Look up the value of Jupiter's radius and calculate the size of the planet in KIC006922244 compared to Jupiter. Use the code cells below to perform your calculations. You may want to create a function that takes the transit depth and stellar radius as arguments and returns the planet's radius."

Using the code cell below, write a function that returns the semi-major axis of a planet (in units of Astronomical Units [AU]) given values of the orbital period and the mass of the central star (these should be given as arguments to the function).

If you have centred your phase-folded lightcurve around zero on the x-axis then $t_{\\rm IS}$ should be a negative number. Obtain an estimate of the time at which the transit ends (we will call this the \"*egress end time*\"). Let's denote this as $t_{\\rm EE}$. The transit duration is then $T_{\\rm dur} = t_{\\rm EE} - t_{\\rm IE}$ (i.e. the time between the start of ingress and the end of egress).\n",

Once you are happy that your function is working, extend it to also return the value of the orbital inclination $i$. Be careful with your units (in particular when converting between radians and degrees!). "
