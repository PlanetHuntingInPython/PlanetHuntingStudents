Using your estimate of the orbital period \\(hint: the period $P=3.522X$ days where $X$ is a digit in the range $0 \\le X \\le 9$\\), and the time of the first transit \\(let's call this $t_0$\\), phase\\-fold the data so that it is symmetric about $t=0$.

Look up the value of Jupiter's radius and calculate the size of the planet in KIC006922244 compared to Jupiter. Use the code cells below to perform your calculations.

This requires you to input certain parameters, such as the planet radius, semimajor axis and orbital inclination. You have already made estimates of some of these values. Use them in ```batman``` and see how good a fit the model is to the data. Try to improve the quality of the fit by varying the parameters of the model."
