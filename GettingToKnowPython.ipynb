    "\n",
    "The environment we will be using to develop our python code in will be CoCalc, which is an implementation of Jupyter notebooks. We will be hosting this for you, meaning that your code will be running on computers in Queen Mary, and sending you your output over the internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "**_This is a jupyter notebook_**. A jupyter notebook allows you to write code in the python programming language, and to annotate it using the the markdown language, all in the same environment (to see what markdown looks like you can double click on this or any other instruction cell and then, when you are done, _**shift+enter**_ to turn it back into the pretty marked up text you are reading now) . You will be able to edit your notebooks either online in CoCalc or, if you prefer, using a local installation of Jupyter notbooks/Anaconda on your own machine. To tell apart markdown cells from code cells, look for the ```In []:``` icon next to the cell.\n",

    "#### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Often data is more complicated than just a single number or character, and storing each data element as a single variable becomes cumbersome. In these situations lists come to our rescue. In a python list you can store any number of things, as well as mixtures of things (again remember Python itself takes care of complicated issues with different kinds of data). To declare a list in python you use square braces:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a *zero based language*, this means that it counts from 0. So if you are looking for the very first element of a list, you want ``` myList[0]``` and if you want the last ```myList[-1]```, here the ```-1``` is a python shorthand for ```end-1```. The rest of the elements of the list can be found using their respective indices.\n",

    "### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a list called myList containing the numbers ```[3,2,6,4,0,1]```.\n",

    "e\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _while_ loops\n",
    "\n",
    "The second type of python loop is a **while** loop. This loop executes _while_ a looping condition is met. For example, the code below loops only while a number starting at 5 and increasing by 1 is smaller than 10:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "An important idea to keep in mind when writing code is making your code readable and hence easy to maintain and extend. \n",

    "A good first step in writing easy to read code is using functions. \n",

    "Functions take a set of arguments and produce a return, allowing for code that is used often to be packaged up and only be written once. \n",

    "def my_function(firstArg, secondArg, thirdArg):\n",
    "    temporaryVariable=firstArg*secondArg+thirdArg\n",
    "    return temporaryVariable\n",
    "```\n",
    "To then use the function defined in your code you can call it\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "a=2\n",
    "b=4\n",
    "c=5\n",
    "d=my_function(a,b,c) \n",
    "```\n",
    "Whenever a function is called you should just use it like you would the value you expect the function to return. If its a number use it as a number, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "1. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns the square root of the sum of their squares, ie $f(x,y)=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. Call this function ```find_hypotenuse```. Test your code\n",
    "2. Using the function you wrote, clean up the code I wrote in the cell below\n",
    "3. **Optional Challenge:** using the function you already wrote and the section on conditional execution, write a function that tests if 3 numbers (a,b,c) form the sides of a right triangle (within a tolerance of $10^{-6}$). If they are, return ```True``` otherwise return ```False```. As a further challenge, make your function work regardless of the order the sides are given in the function arguments (hint: remember the hypothenuse is the largest side of a right handed triangle).

    "## Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic python by itself is great, but python's strongest selling point is the huge set of packages that come with the language. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be taking advantage of the NumPy, matplotlib and plotly packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy offers a wide range of mathematical functions and operations, as well as the numpy.array, which is a superior way to store data compared to using lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib will allow you to painlessly make beautiful plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly allows you to make interactive plots that will be very useful when we come to look at the Kepler data in the notebook **KeplerDataIntro**\n",
    "\n",
    "To import packages in python, all we have to do is use the `import`command\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now all numpy functions and methods will have been imported into the ```np``` _namespace_. All that this means is that all the numpy methods can now be accessed similarly to the following examples:\n",

    "x=np.pi/4.\n",
    "y=np.sin(x)\n",
    "```\n",

    "The reason we do this is to avoid overwriting other functions and variable names when we import a library. If for example we already defined a function ```power()```, importing numpy as described above will not overwrite it.\n",

    "#### numpy np.array\n",
    "\n",
    "numpy arrays are awesome. Numpy arrays are way faster than python lists, while allowing you to do maths with them in a much more intuitive way. The only drawback is that you need to make sure that the data you put into your array is of the same _type_. i.e. Don't mix numbers and strings! \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to create a numpy array:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Making an array full of ones or zeros of a specified length\n",

    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "myArray3=3*myArray2\n",

    "\n",
    "4. By reading from a file (more on this later)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading from files\n",
    "\n",
    "numpy gives you the ability to read data from a text file. This is done with the `np.loadtxt()` function. This function takes a filename as an argument and reads the content and returns a set of arrays, with one array for each column of data. The following example illustrates how this works:\n",

    "```Python\n",
    "squares=np.asarray([1,2,3,4,5,6])**2\n",

    "- You can append data to numpy arrays, this is useful if you do not know how much data you will have, though beware you have to append data of the same type as what is already in the array. Also using ```array.append()``` will make your code run slower (if that is important to you. append is a member function of the np.array so it is called slightly differently than the functions we have seen so far):\n",

    "- ```plt.tight_layout()``` for when your axis labels are clipping out of the canvas.\n",
